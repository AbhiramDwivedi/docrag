# BOLT Protocol Specification v2.1

## Overview
BOLT (Binary Object Logging Transfer) is a high-performance protocol designed for real-time data streaming between distributed systems. This specification covers BOLT v2.1 implementation details.

## Protocol Features
- Binary serialization for optimal performance
- Built-in compression support
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- End-to-end encryption

## Message Format
BOLT messages consist of:
1. Header (8 bytes)
2. Payload length (4 bytes) 
3. Compressed payload (variable)
4. Checksum (4 bytes)

## Implementation Notes
BOLT v2.1 introduces backward compatibility with v2.0 while adding support for:
- Stream multiplexing
- Priority queuing
- Enhanced error handling

The protocol is implemented in multiple languages including Java, Python, and Go. Reference implementations are available in the BOLT GitHub repository.

## Performance Benchmarks
BOLT v2.1 achieves:
- 99th percentile latency: < 5ms
- Throughput: > 1M messages/sec
- Compression ratio: 3:1 average
