# Phase III Implementation Guide

## Overview

Phase III of the DocQuest agentic implementation introduces **Advanced Intelligence** capabilities, transforming DocQuest from a simple document search tool into a sophisticated document analysis agent with relationship understanding, knowledge graph integration, and comprehensive reporting.

## New Capabilities

### 1. Document Relationship Analysis Plugin (`document_relationships.py`)

Provides sophisticated analysis of relationships between documents:

- **Document Similarity**: Find documents similar to a target document or query
- **Document Clustering**: Group documents by thematic similarity
- **Cross-Reference Detection**: Identify references between documents
- **Thematic Analysis**: Extract and analyze themes across the collection
- **Content Evolution Tracking**: Track how content changes over time
- **Citation Analysis**: Find and analyze citations in documents

#### Usage Examples:
```python
from agent.factory import create_phase3_agent

agent = create_phase3_agent()

# Find similar documents
response = agent.process_query("find documents similar to budget_report.pdf")

# Cluster documents by theme
response = agent.process_query("cluster documents by theme into 5 groups")

# Analyze document themes
response = agent.process_query("analyze themes across all documents")
```

### 2. Knowledge Graph Implementation (`knowledge_graph.py`)

Provides a knowledge graph representation of document relationships and entities:

- **Entity Management**: Store and query entities (people, organizations, concepts)
- **Relationship Mapping**: Define and traverse relationships between entities
- **Graph Analytics**: Calculate centrality, detect communities, find paths
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract entities from document content
- **Graph Visualization**: Export data for visualization tools

#### Usage Examples:
```python
from ingest.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph, Entity, Relationship

# Create knowledge graph
kg = KnowledgeGraph("data/knowledge_graph.db")

# Add entities
entity = Entity(
    id="project_alpha",
    type="project",
    name="Project Alpha",
    properties={"status": "active", "priority": "high"}
)
kg.add_entity(entity)

# Find related entities
related = kg.find_related_entities("project_alpha")
```

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting Plugin (`comprehensive_reporting.py`)

Generates structured reports and analytics about document collections:

- **Collection Summary**: Overview of document collection statistics
- **Activity Reports**: Recent changes, additions, and modifications
- **Thematic Analysis**: Analysis of content themes and trends
- **Cross-Document Insights**: Relationships and connections analysis
- **Usage Analytics**: System usage patterns and performance
- **Health Reports**: Collection health and quality assessment
- **Custom Reports**: User-defined criteria and analysis

#### Usage Examples:
```python
# Generate collection summary
response = agent.process_query("generate a summary report of the document collection")

# Create activity report
response = agent.process_query("show me activity report for last week")

# Generate insights report
response = agent.process_query("provide insights about document relationships")
```

## Enhanced Agent Capabilities

### Advanced Query Classification

The agent now intelligently routes queries to appropriate plugins based on sophisticated pattern matching:

```python
# Relationship analysis queries
"find documents similar to compliance policy"
"cluster documents by theme"
"analyze relationships between project files"

# Reporting queries  
"generate a comprehensive report on document trends"
"show usage analytics for the system"
"create a health report for the collection"

# Multi-step complex queries
"analyze budget themes and generate a trend report"
"find similar financial documents and summarize relationships"
```

### Multi-Step Query Planning

Phase III enables complex queries that require coordination between multiple plugins:

1. **Query Classification**: Identify intent and required capabilities
2. **Plugin Selection**: Choose appropriate plugins for execution
3. **Parameter Generation**: Use LLM to generate structured parameters
4. **Execution Coordination**: Execute plugins in optimal order
5. **Result Synthesis**: Combine and synthesize results intelligently

## Agent Factory Functions

New factory functions for Phase III:

```python
from agent.factory import (
    create_phase3_agent,     # Full Phase III capabilities
    create_default_agent,    # Phase II capabilities (default)
    create_minimal_agent     # Phase I capabilities only
)

# Create agent with all Phase III features
agent = create_phase3_agent()

# Create agent with specific plugins
agent = create_agent_with_plugins([
    "semantic_search",
    "document_relationships", 
    "comprehensive_reporting"
])
```

## Configuration and Setup

### Database Requirements

Phase III requires both vector store and knowledge graph databases:

```
data/
├── vector.index          # FAISS vector index
├── vector_store.db       # Enhanced metadata database
└── knowledge_graph.db    # Knowledge graph database (new)
```

### Dependencies

Additional dependencies for Phase III:
- `networkx`: Graph analysis and algorithms
- `numpy`: Numerical operations for embeddings
- Vector store support

### Memory and Performance

Phase III adds caching and optimization:
- **Query Result Caching**: Cache frequent query results
- **Plugin Result Caching**: Cache expensive plugin operations
- **Relationship Caching**: Cache relationship analysis results
- **Knowledge Graph Optimization**: Efficient graph traversal

## Migration from Previous Phases

### From Phase II to Phase III

Phase III is fully backward compatible:

```python
# Existing Phase II code works unchanged
from agent.factory import create_default_agent
agent = create_default_agent()  # Still uses Phase II capabilities

# Upgrade to Phase III
from agent.factory import create_phase3_agent  
agent = create_phase3_agent()   # Adds Phase III capabilities
```

### Database Migration

No database migration required - Phase III adds new tables without affecting existing ones.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Document Analysis Workflow

```python
agent = create_phase3_agent()

# Step 1: Analyze collection
summary = agent.process_query("generate a summary report of the document collection")

# Step 2: Find relationships
relationships = agent.process_query("analyze relationships between documents")

# Step 3: Generate insights
insights = agent.process_query("provide insights about document connections")
```

### 2. Research Support

```python
# Find related research papers
similar_docs = agent.process_query("find documents similar to research_paper.pdf")

# Analyze citation patterns
citations = agent.process_query("find citations in research documents")

# Track research evolution
evolution = agent.process_query("track how research topics have evolved")
```

### 3. Business Intelligence

```python
# Analyze business document themes
themes = agent.process_query("analyze themes in business documents")

# Generate activity report
activity = agent.process_query("show me activity report for last month")

# Create trend analysis
trends = agent.process_query("analyze trends in document usage")
```
