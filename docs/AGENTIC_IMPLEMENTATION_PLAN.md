# DocQuest Agentic Architecture Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the transformation of DocQuest from a simple semantic search tool into an intelligent document analysis agent capable of sophisticated reasoning and multi-source information synthesis. The implementation is divided into three phases, each building upon the previous one.

## Code Requirements and Constraints

### Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing CLI and API interfaces must continue to work
- **Testability**: All components must be unit testable
- **Type Safety**: Use Python type hints throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when plugins fail
- **Simplicity**: Favor simple, maintainable solutions suitable for local-first use
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with clear interfaces

### Required Interfaces
```python
# Agent must support this public interface
class Agent:
    def process_query(self, question: str) -> str:
        """Process natural language query and return response."""
        pass
    
    def get_capabilities(self) -> List[str]:
        """Return list of agent capabilities for introspection."""
        pass
    
    def explain_reasoning(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Return explanation of last query processing steps."""
        pass

# Plugins must implement this interface  
class Plugin:
    def execute(self, params: dict) -> dict:
        """Execute plugin operation with given parameters."""
        pass
    
    def get_info(self) -> PluginInfo:
        """Return plugin metadata and capabilities."""
        pass
    
    def validate_params(self, params: dict) -> bool:
        """Validate parameters before execution."""
        pass

# Plugin registry for discoverability
class PluginRegistry:
    def register(self, plugin: Plugin) -> None:
        """Register a plugin with the agent framework."""
        pass
    
    def discover_plugins(self) -> List[Plugin]:
        """Discover and return available plugins."""
        pass
```

### Integration Points
- **Current CLI**: `cli/ask.py` `answer()` function behavior must be preserved
- **Current API**: `api/app.py` endpoints must work with agent backend
- **Vector Store**: Must use existing `ingest/vector_store.py` and `ingest/embed.py`
- **Configuration**: Must use existing `config/config.py` settings system

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Example test structure for agent framework
class TestAgentFramework:
    def test_backward_compatibility(self):
        """Ensure all existing queries continue to work."""
        pass
    
    def test_plugin_registration(self):
        """Verify plugins can be registered and discovered."""
        pass
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test graceful failure scenarios."""
        pass
    
    def test_performance_benchmarks(self):
        """Validate performance within acceptable bounds."""
        pass

# Integration tests
class TestAgentIntegration:
    def test_cli_integration(self):
        """Test agent integration with existing CLI."""
        pass
    
    def test_api_integration(self):
        """Test agent integration with web API."""
        pass
```

### Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage for all agent and plugin code
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of complete query workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against current implementation
- **Regression Tests**: Automated testing of existing query examples
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Comprehensive failure mode testing
- **Documentation Tests**: All interfaces must have working examples

### Monitoring and Observability
```python
# Logging and metrics framework
class AgentMetrics:
    def track_query_performance(self, query: str, duration: float) -> None:
        """Track query execution time for performance monitoring."""
        pass
    
    def track_plugin_usage(self, plugin_name: str, success: bool) -> None:
        """Monitor plugin usage patterns and success rates."""
        pass
    
    def track_error_rates(self, error_type: str, component: str) -> None:
        """Track error patterns for debugging and reliability."""
        pass

# Health monitoring
class AgentHealth:
    def check_plugin_health(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
        """Check health status of all registered plugins."""
        pass
    
    def check_system_resources(self) -> ResourceStatus:
        """Monitor memory, CPU, and storage usage."""
        pass
```

**Required Metrics:**
- Query response times (P50, P95, P99)
- Plugin execution success rates
- Error rates by component and type
- Memory usage patterns
- Vector store performance metrics
- User query patterns and trends

### Security and Privacy Requirements
- **Data Locality**: All document processing must remain local
- **API Key Security**: Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and plugin parameters
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Plugins should not have access to system resources beyond defined interfaces
- **Audit Logging**: Log all agent decisions and plugin executions for transparency
- **Privacy Preservation**: No document content should be logged or transmitted except to OpenAI for query processing

```python
# Security framework example
class AgentSecurity:
    def validate_plugin_permissions(self, plugin: Plugin) -> bool:
        """Ensure plugin operates within security boundaries."""
        pass
    
    def sanitize_user_input(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Clean and validate user input before processing."""
        pass
    
    def audit_agent_decision(self, query: str, plugins_used: List[str], result: str) -> None:
        """Log agent decisions for transparency and debugging."""
        pass
```

### Deployment and Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Agent framework should support multiple worker processes
- **State Management**: Agent state should be stateless or externally managed
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic configuration updates without restart
- **Plugin Hot-Reloading**: Ability to add/update plugins without system restart
- **Resource Management**: Configurable limits on memory and CPU usage
- **Graceful Degradation**: System should continue operating when plugins fail

```python
# Scalability framework
class AgentScaling:
    def configure_worker_pool(self, max_workers: int) -> None:
        """Configure parallel processing capabilities."""
        pass
    
    def load_balance_queries(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Distribute queries across available workers."""
        pass
    
    def manage_plugin_lifecycle(self, plugin_name: str, action: str) -> bool:
        """Dynamically load/unload plugins."""
        pass
```

### Success Criteria
- All existing queries produce same or better results

- Response time under 30 seconds for complex queries
- Graceful failure handling with meaningful error messages
- Plugin system allows dynamic capability discovery
